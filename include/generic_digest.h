/**
 * @file
 * @brief Abstract typedefs for hash function overrides using the generic interface.
 * @details
 * Do not include this file. Instead, either include `override_sha256_generic.h` or
 * `override_shake256_256_generic.h`, depending on the specific algorithm you are overriding.
 *
 * For each digest algorithm (SHA-256 and/or SHAKE256/256), the library allows to override its internal implementation.
 * The main use case is hardware acceleration.
 *
 * If your platform is compatible with the internal format of the library, then it is preferred to use the internal
 * interface rather than the generic interface specified here.
 *
 * When supplying an override using the generic interface, you will have to implement 3 functions (per algorithm, that
 * you are overriding):
 * - initialize
 * - update
 * - finalize
 *
 * The library guarantees that the functions are called in the following order:
 * - exactly one call to the initialize function
 * - 0 or more calls to the update function
 * - exactly one call to the finalize function
 *
 * Per thread, there will be at most one digest in use at any one time. This implies that if you use the library single
 * threaded, then you could use a single statically allocated context. In that case the opaque `context` parameter does
 * not necessarily have to be provided or used (i.e., it could simply be 0).
 *
 * **Error handling**
 *
 * For performance reasons, the functions themselves do not provide a means to return errors. If your digest
 * implementation can fail, then the failing function should store its error in a global (or thread-local)
 * context. This context must then be checked after each library call.
 *
 * For example (not using bit error resilient booleans for readability):
 *
 * ```
 * static bool digest_error;
 *
 * digest_error = false;
 * XmssError result = xmss_generate_private_key();
 * if (result != XMSS_OKAY || digest_error) {
 *     // handle errors
 * }
 * ```
