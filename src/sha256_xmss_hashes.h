 * @brief
 * Contains all SHA-256 hash functions in a single abstraction structure.
 *
 * @details
 * If abstraction is disabled (i.e., if SHA-256 is the only enabled hash algorithm),
 * then this structure is not defined. Instead, the XMSS_xxx() helper macros will
 * directly expand into the sha256_xxx() specialized hash functions. This allows the compiler to optimize: it saves
 * an indirection, and possibly eliminates instantiating the sha256_xxx() functions by inlining them.
